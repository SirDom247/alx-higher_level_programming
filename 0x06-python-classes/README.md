##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
*   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
*   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
*   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified).

What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
What is a property.
What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python.
What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python.
How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class.
How to bind attributes to object and classes.
What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain.
How does Python find the attributes of an object or class.
How to use the `getattr` function.

* **0. My first square** - Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square. - `0-square.py`.
* **1. Square with size** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `0-square.py`). - `1-square.py`.
* **2. Size validation** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `1-square.py`). - `2-square.py`.
* **3. Area of a square** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `2-square.py`). - `3-square.py`.
* **4. Access and update private attribute** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `3-square.py`). - `4-square.py`.
* **5. Printing a square** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `4-square.py`). - `5-square.py`.
* **6. Coordinates of a square** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `5-square.py`). - `6-square.py`.
* **7. Singly linked list** - Write a class `Node` that defines a node of a singly linked list by given attributes. - `100-singly_linked_list.py`.
* **8. Print Square instance** - Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `6-square.py`). - `101-square.py`.

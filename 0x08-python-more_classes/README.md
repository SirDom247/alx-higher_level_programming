##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`.
*   All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`).
*   All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
*   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
*   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
*   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified).
